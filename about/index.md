Hi,

I am an electrical engineer turned molecular biologist, currently in the fifth year of my PhD at [IMBA](https://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at/) in Vienna, Austria. Formerly employed in a lab working on RNA biology, I prefer seeing myself as 25% wet-lab scientist and 75% bioinformatic data analyst. In addition to things directly related to my PhD I enjoy wrestling with messy data and figuring out ways of visualising it in an easily understandable manner. Aside from science I spend my time dabbling in design & illustration and keep trying my hand on urban and landscape photography.
