I am an electrical engineer turned molecular biologist, currently doing my PhD at [IMBA](https://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at/) in Vienna, Austria, at the interface of RNA biology and bioinformatics. In addition to things directly related to my PhD I enjoy wrestling with messy data and figuring out ways of visualising it in an easily understandable manner. Aside from science I spend my time dabbling in design & illustration and keep trying my hand on urban and landscape photography.

Before finding my way to the natural sciences I was a unix sysadmin, paramedic, audio & video technician, and a clinical technical specialist for cochlear implants.
