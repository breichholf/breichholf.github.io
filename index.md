I am an electrical engineer turned molecular biologist, currently doing my PhD at [IMBA](http://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at/) in Vienna, Austria, at the interface of RNA biology and bioinformatics. In addition to stuff directly related to my PhD I am interested in modelling of biological systems and kinetics, as well as pathfinding algorithms. Aside from science I spend my time dabbling in design & illustration and keep trying my hand on urban and landscape photography.

Before finding my way to the natural sciences I was a unix sysadmin, paramedic, audio & video technician, and a clinical technical specialist for cochlear implants.
