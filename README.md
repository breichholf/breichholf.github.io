# Personal website

This is my revised set up for a personal website and blog. It's a fork from **@[emaadmanzoor][1]**'s [blog][2]. The included online CV has been adapted and included from **@[jglovier][12]** [resume-template][13].

CSS has been adapted to be consistent throughout.

Here are the details from the original README:

## Design

The theme this blog wears is hand-crafted; I found it way easier than adapting someone else's theme.

Some of the themes I considered before rolling my own are:

   * [Minimal Mistakes][3]: This is a beautiful theme by Michael Rose, but the code presented too great a learning curve.
   * [So Simple][4]: Another beautiful theme by Michael Rose, with the same problem as above.
   * [Greyshade][5]: A Medium-esque Octopress theme.
   * [Left][6]: A clean, white Jekyll theme.

The design has some key influencers:

   * [The PureCSS Blog Layout][7]: PureCSS also forms the backbone of this blog.
   * [Medium.com][8]: Particularly their layout for an individual post.
   * [Aaron Moodie's Blog][9]: Follows a Tumble-log style, with different post types.
   * [mnmlist][10]: An inspiration for life too.
   
I also use icons from [FontAwesome][11].
