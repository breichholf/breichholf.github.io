# Data analysis and visualisation
- skill: Data analysis and visualisation
  description: I started automating data entry and handling in all previous positions. To perform a tailored data analysis, I taught myself python (using NumPy and pandas) to read out and process specialised machine data, and R (most recently, tidyverse) to analyse and visualise high throughput sequencing data. Colleagues regularly consult me for help analysing data, quickly prompting me to think outside of the box and suggest both analytical methods and options for visualising their results.

# Data & Scientific Presentation
- skill: Data and Scientific Presentation
  description: Presenting my research progress at least once every two months has trained me to communicate results concisely and in a compelling manner. Be it in a small group of 10 people, or in front of an audience of 200, I enjoy presenting and conveying data in an understandable manner.

# Teaching, Coaching and Mentoring
- skill: Teaching, Coaching &amp; Mentoring
  description: I have several years of experience effectively communicating various concepts, both in and outside of science. From establishing a baseline of knowledge, to explaining details in simple terms, I enjoy helping people learn new concepts. In addition, working on my own and assisting on others' personal development has taught me how to ask good questions and lead people to fulfill their goals.
