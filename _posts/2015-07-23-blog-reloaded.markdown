Putting a day of sick-leave to good use, I've decided to set up a blog. It's time to start writing and putting my thoughts down on 'paper'. Thanks to my education, expect entries across a broad array of topics, from life sciences and the required data analysis to general programming frustrations.

Motivated by a recent video on daily routines[^1] and a general month of working on a more healthy nutritional life styles I'm trying to make the following simple changes:

- Mornings:
    + Get up at a consistent time every day (somewhere in the ballpark of 5.30/6.00)
    + Monday, Wednesday & Friday morning: workout

- Evenings:
    + Cook lunch for the next day
    + Gather thoughts and write on the blog at least once a week (Mondays perhaps?) 
    + Get to bed regularly at 11pm at the latest

Ideally I'd like to add a few other things in the mornings (eg. meditate, cardio workout Tuesday & Thursday), and evenings (eg. pick up and read a book every now and then).

Let's see how things go.
