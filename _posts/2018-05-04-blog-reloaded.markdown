Over the past years I've come to the conclusion that writing down my thoughts helps me put my mind in order.

In addition, I'm constantly working on keeping up a healthy daily routine[^1]. I have found that mornings work best for me, so here is my general plan:

- Get up at a consistent time every day (5.30 - 6.00)
- Monday, Wednesday & Friday morning: workout
- Cycle to work when weather permits

In addition, I'm making an effort to start writing more regularly, read more to relax or for constant education. I'm aiming for this to translate in to some ramblings on this blog, following my thought and path in life.
