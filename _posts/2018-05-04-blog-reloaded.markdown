Over the past years I've come to the conclusion that writing down my thoughts helps me put my mind in order.

In addition, I'm constantly working on keeping up a healthy daily routine[^1]. I have found that mornings work best for me, so here is my general plan:

- Get up at a consistent time every day (5.30 - 6.00)
- Monday, Wednesday & Friday morning: workout
- Cycle to work when weather permits

In addition, I'm making an effort to start writing more regularly, read more to relax or for constant education.
